                  <p class="blog-text">
                    Engineers are often known for the art of being resourceful,
                    minimalistic, and innovative (i.e., jugaadu). When this
                    translates from submitting a course project at midnight to
                    much bigger scales, we can create impact that can solve a
                    lot of the global problems. The capacity to do so can be
                    imparted through the study of policy. In its 75th year of
                    independence, the most prominent policies of India today are
                    those revolving around sustainability. Sustainable
                    development meets the needs of the present without
                    compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
                    own needs. Clean energy is one such focus sector to promote
                    sustainable development. In the 2021 global climate
                    negotiations, India established a new commitment to reach
                    ‘net-zero’ greenhouse gas emissions (a reduction in
                    greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible,
                    with any remaining emissions re-absorbed from the atmosphere
                    by oceans or forests) in 50 years. Recognising the impact
                    engineers can have, the United Nations General Secretary, Mr
                    Antonio Guterres, will be addressing the students of IIT
                    Bombay on the 19th of October, 2022, as part of the India@75
                    showcase. We have a closer look at how engineers and
                    technocrats can directly mould our future through the
                    policies they design.

                    IIT Bombay, like other higher education institutions in the
                    country, is mandated by the Rights of Persons with
                    Disabilities Act of 2016 to practice affirmative action and
                    provide a minimum of 5% of the total seats to students with
                    disabilities. Since only individuals with a minimum of 40%
                    of the relevant disabilities are eligible to constitute this
                    section, the actual number of students in the institute who
                    deal with disabilities of varying extents is probably much
                    higher. We reached out to some of these students to get
                    insights into the diverse challenges they face: in both
                    their academic endeavours and social lives, as well as to
                    determine how well the institute fulfils the duty placed
                    upon it by the RPWD Act - making the campus accessible to
                    all.

                  2021. My experience with i-SURP 2021 was wonderful as I got an
                  excellent guide, Professor Dhwanil Shukla, an awesome senior
                  student working on the same project and an interesting

                  Howdy fellas! I am Dhruv, a final year undergrad in the

                  the country and the exact opposite is reflected in my room
                  here at hostel 9. I listen to a lot of music - from 70s rock
                  to 00s rap to the recent pop hits, I’ve explored a lot. I used
                  to play some football in high school, but recent experiments
                  suggest my goal-scoring days are over. I do enjoy table tennis
                  and am always open to a match. I am a counter strike addict,
                  so if I’m not answering your calls I probably am carrying my
