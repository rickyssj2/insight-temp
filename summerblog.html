                    What Can I say about my experience! It’s been such a rollercoaster experience from the day I started preparing for the intern season to today where I'm done with my internship and looking forward to my fourth year and future career options. When I look back at this experience and all the things that I faced, I can just say “Guys! Anything can happen anytime to anyone. There are bad days where you’ll feel nothing is going your way but at the same time you’ll have your share of good ones. So just stay tight, Enjoy the process and in IITB Lingo what I could say is “Thoda Chill Maaro. Ho jayega Sort”

                    Hi everyone, I am Mehul, a final-year student in the Department of Physics. I am from Bhopal, a city famous for its gas tragedy lakes. 
I did my 3rd-year summer internship as an analog design engineer at Texas Instruments (TI), Bangalore. I obtained the internship opportunity via the PT cell. TI is a frequent company at IITB and one of the most popular for people pursuing core EE. I enjoyed the various EE courses and labs that EP does as part of its core curriculum. Also, after getting a flavor of academic research in my 2nd year, I wanted more exposure. I am looking for a dynamic, non-monotonous, and challenging lifestyle, and I doubt academia can offer it. But then, I always have enjoyed solving problems. Corporate R&D in EE seemed like the perfect middle ground.

                    Hello, I am Tanirika Roy, a fourth-year student in the Chemical Engineering Department. I am a foodie and a music lover. Travelling is my second nature. Being a Punekar, I relish my midday naps. [ChE Labs *evil grin*] I like Chemical Engineering, but not enough to pursue proper core jobs requiring me to design reactors. FMCG was a viable option as a future career path because it had a good variety in their profiles - industrial research, supply chain management, product development, among others. I also aspire to pursue higher studies after my B. Tech, so the real dilemma was Research Internship vs. Corporate Internship.

I will be sharing my intern experience through this blog. I hope you find this blog helpful and hopeful at the same time.

I was really lucky to have the chance to intern at Sony this summer as a parallel programming researcher and that’s where this blog comes into the picture.

I heard about the internship through my seniors. I wanted to pursue software engineering in my 3rd year Summers, and DE Shaw is among the day 1 software companies that come to insti, and that is why I decided to pursue the internship.

I hail from Indore, the cleanest city in the country and the exact opposite is reflected in my room here at hostel 9. I listen to a lot of music - from 70s rock to 00s rap to the recent pop hits, I’ve explored a lot. I used to play some football in high school, but recent experiments suggest my goal-scoring days are over. I do enjoy table tennis and am always open to a match. I am a counter strike addict, so if I’m not answering your calls I probably am carrying my friends there (:
