                <h1>Manava Gada - LEAP</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi! I am Manav Gada, a 3rd-year undergraduate majoring in Mechanical Engineering and pursuing a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. I utilize my spare time mostly in sports (volleyball and basketball) and binge-watching web series. Apart from an inclination towards core subjects, I have developed a slight inclination towards DSA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you know the worst part of a typical holiday break at IITB? Watching others do something productive and developing a not-so-obvious sort of FOMO. This drives you to do something productive. With a similar intent, I applied for a couple of IAFs out of some 'n' companies (n is not a very large number :D) that opened up for us (2nd year, Mechanical) after the 4th semester. LEAP (Leading Enterprise in Asset Pooling) India was one of the companies to which I applied for the 'Analyst' profile. If I remember correctly, the recruitment process was pretty straightforward. It involved resume filtering followed by an interview, which was mainly composed of resume grinding. I was asked to elaborate on my contribution to the tech team and explain other mentioned projects. Apart from these, basic HR-type questions were asked like “What is your motivation to apply for this role?”, “What do you know about the company?”, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My joining date was somewhere during May end and my internship period lasted for about 2 months. Exact job details vary from person to person. Primarily, each of us had to report to a person in senior management based on the project allotted to us catering to their needs and our interests (for instance, someone had to report to the CFO for finance-based projects, etc). My mentor was a senior from the Forecasting and Planning department as my project involved predictive analysis. The project included warehouse visits and regular review meets with mentors and other members of senior management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from the actual skillsets that I gained (again varies from person to person as each of us was working on different projects) that I gained during the internship, I would like to mention some personal highlights. Firstly, this was my first ever offline corporate exposure and it was a great experience. Honestly, my sleep cycle has never been better than it was during this period, as I had to get up early, travel and reach the office on time. I upgraded my interpersonal skills to a whole new level as we constantly had to interact with employees, clients and shareholders. The employees there were very friendly towards us (interns) and we developed a good bond with them, frequently went out, celebrated birthdays, etc. Overall, the experience was a great value addition to me and served as a gear-up for the 3rd year intern season.
