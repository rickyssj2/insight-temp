              <h3>
                Placements, internal ‘brain drain’ and academic life of
                undergraduates at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay
                (IITB)
              </h3>
              <p>
                The professors of IIT Bombay recently conducted a study to
                examine the factors that affect a student’s choice when they
                decide between a core and a non-core job. How the ‘realisation’
                that they are going to opt for a non-core job creates a
                disconnect with academics, especially core subjects. Their paper
                also addresses the glorification of high packages made by
                foreign companies, which are often seen in headlines every year
                when this is really just a misrepresentation of facts. For this
                study, they made use of the PT Cell data for 2014-18 and results
                of a survey that was floated among graduating batches of
                2020-2023. Here are a few excerpts from their paper that shed
                light on the key insights that explain the preference for
                non-core jobs over core.
              </p>
              <p>
                Factors like more flexibility and growth in non-core jobs
                coupled with several institute related factors like lack of core
                opportunities, internships and skill gap in curriculum affects
                placement preferences. Along with this the glorification of PoRs
                (Position of Responsibilities) and extracurricular activities
                encourages students to focus more on them relative to academics.
                This ends up affecting every batch of incoming students and
                creates a self-reinforcing cycle.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is definitely a strong non-core preference among students
                but the analysis clearly highlights that Salary may not be the
                dominating factor affecting student choices as the median
                salaries for core and non-core jobs were similar for most
                branches (there are certain caveats regarding this statement
                which are listed in the paper)
              </p>
              <p><ul>The paper lists down several solutions as follows:
                <li><i>The PT Cell should attempt to collect more well-paying core profiles. They need to arrange more slots for well-paying core profiles in the initial days of placement.</i></li>
                <li><i>To generate technical engagement there is a need to add projects related to ‘real-life’ problems in the curriculum.</i></li>
                <li><i>An industry wide professional survey should be conducted to assess availability of job profiles and salaries and using this data the institute should re-design placement strategies and slotting algorithms</i></li>
                <li><i>IITs have evolved a ‘mixed’ curriculum that simultaneously tries to be (a) science-driven (research focus), practice-driven (for the industry) and (c) generic (with focus on basic stuff).The existing curriculum does none of these particularly well.</i></li>
            </ul>
