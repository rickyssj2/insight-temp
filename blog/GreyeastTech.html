                        <h1>Greyeast Technologies Pvt Ltd</h1>
                        <p>
                            My name is Atharva Patankar. I completed my Mtech from the Department of Energy Science and
                            Engineering at IIT Bombay in 2017. I am one of the co-founders of Greyeast Technologies Pvt
                            Ltd. My other two co-founders are Ambareesh Phadnavis and Sampada Phadnavis. My KRA includes
                            Engineering operations, Fundraising, partnerships & business development.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Can you tell us a little bit more about your StartUp? What problem are you trying to
                                    solve?</h4>
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                My MTech course project was focused on designing a photobioreactor, a published patent.
                                A photobioreactor is a device that uses light sources to cultivate phototropic
                                microorganisms. These microorganisms utilize CO2 & chemical compounds as substrates and
                                light to produce biomass. Different species of organisms can produce various valuable
                                byproducts. So in my Mtech course project, I came across the concept of using
                                microorganisms to sequester carbon and associated concepts of bioenergy. One of my
                                co-founders, Ambareesh Phadnavis, completed his post-graduate studies at TU Denmark and
                                was serving as a scientist in my laboratory, which is how we first met. Greyeast
                                Technologies was founded to utilize microorganisms to degrade chemical compounds that
                                are difficult to break down naturally. These compounds cause significant environmental
                                issues and are produced by chemically intensive industries like paper production,
                                dyeing, pharmaceuticals, etc. The effluent streams of these industries contain several
                                non-biodegradable wastes with high Chemical Oxygen Demand. We deploy sustainable
                                biological solutions that can reduce this COD and help in the secondary treatment of the
                                waste effluents from these industries.
                            </p>
                            <li>
                                <h4>
                                    On your website, it seems that you have a whole line of products where you are
                                    tackling different kinds of problems related to the field. Can you elaborate a bit
                                    more on that?
                                </h4>
                                <p>
                                    We are "managers of microorganisms," i.e. we regulate their growth according to the
                                    necessity of the industry. For example, one of our products is EffluePure, where we
                                    grow organisms which feed on industry effluents, thereby reducing the pollution
                                    potential of the discharge. On the other hand, 'Vardhanol' is used to regulate the
                                    growth of microbes in molasses. If not controlled, these microbes bring down ethanol
                                    production efficiency from molasses. Another one of our products, JantuKill, is a
                                    non-alcoholic disinfectant which controls algae growth to reduce fouling issues in
                                    water tanks, chillers, storage ponds etc.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Can you tell us a bit about your journey in the entrepreneurship and the start-up
                                    sector?</h4>
                                <p>I had this thing for entrepreneurship in the back of my mind. This thought process
                                    culminated in serious action when Prof. Milind Atrey from Mech. advised me to attend
                                    team workshops at Desai Sethi Center for Entrepreneurship. I was introduced to
                                    Business concepts which fascinated me further to explore the topic. After completing
                                    my Master's degree in 2017, I worked at the Society for Innovation and
                                    Entrepreneurship, SINE IIT Bombay. I simultaneously worked part-time for Greyeast
                                    Technologies Pvt Ltd, too. Later I left SINE and started working full-time in
                                    Greyeast Technologies Pvt Ltd and also went on to become one of its co-founders.
                                    Working at SINE provided me with excellent exposure to the entrepreneurship world.
                                    This, in some way, has also dictated my role in my current company. I look after the
                                    company's operations and business and seek out funding opportunities that help us
                                    grow further.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>
                                    What was the motivation for working in a StartUp? When did you come up with it?
                                </h4>
                                <p>
                                    The motivation for this particular idea was from my MTech project, which was related
                                    to this field. Secondly, talking to my professors helped me understand that there is
                                    significant scope for innovation in the energy and environment space. Thirdly,
                                    during the market research, I understood that there is a great deal of impact and
                                    scalability to the idea of start-ups related to water treatment and environmental
                                    conservation. I had seen the problem of water pollution in my hometown, Ballarpur,
                                    in my childhood due to the emissions from paper mills and mines in the neighbouring
                                    areas. The problem seemed genuine to me, and that is why I decided to move ahead
                                    with this idea and work for it in my professional career.

                                <p>As I mentioned earlier, Ambareesh and I met during IITB days, and the rest followed.
                                    Talking about 1st generation entrepreneurs like me, acquiring initial funding is a
                                    significant constraint. Gone are the days when people had to seek Loans. The
                                    policies today are in favour of entrepreneurs, where a lot of grant fund schemes are
                                    available to kick start the venture. We followed a similar strategy. Following are
                                    some of the funds which we acquired:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>ANIC ARISE Grant was awarded by Atal innovation Mission powered by Niti Aayog.
                                        The organization that provides these grants had selected a few companies under
                                        different problem statements. We were selected under the problem statement,
                                        which aimed at providing robust solid waste management solutions for the food
                                        processing industry. </li>
                                    <li>We also acquired a small seed funding from NIDHI PRAYAS at SINE. NIDHI PRAYAS is
                                        a seed fund for early-stage start-ups that provides financial support for up to
                                        10 lakhs to young start-ups to develop their product. We got to develop Jantu
                                        Kill.</li>
                                    <li>Our 3rd source was DRDO Dare to Dream 2.0 Contest. We won first prize in the
                                        life sciences category. Here we are dealing with explosive waste treatment using
                                        bioremediation.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    As you would notice, we have acquired and enjoyed unconventional funding methods
                                    that differ from general societal notions of funding from Angel investors or Venture
                                    Capitals. This seemed the correct way to move forward, especially for us as a deep
                                    technology company. Those conventional methods to acquire funding might work for
                                    software-based start-ups, but for companies like us working on hardcore technology
                                    with
                                    a long gestation period, government grants and innovation funding schemes are a more
                                    viable alternative. I feel the knowledge about these alternatives is also a result
                                    of my
                                    experience at SINE.
                                </p>
                                <p>Through my experience over the last two years, I think I have learned a couple of things 
                                    about start-ups. First, it's essential to have co-founders from diverse backgrounds to 
                                    help the company's growth in their unique way. Secondly, you have to be very strategic 
                                    while deploying your products. You have to identify the problem and then solve it 
                                    correctly. We have already treated 250-300 million litres of water in the past two years, 
                                    and our product has been employed in around10-15 industries. So for an enormous 
                                    social impact of reducing pollution, you will have to identify the fine problems that are 
                                    indicators of it, like foul odour or colour of the water when effluents are discharged. And 
                                    you get this knowledge when you work on the ground and talk to industry experts
                                    </p>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4> Can you tell us briefly about the technology used and the challenges in developing it?
                                </h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>We use fermentation and bioreaction methodologies to utilize organic waste as a substrate and produce value-added products applicable to water treatment, food fortification and nutraceuticals.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><p>
                                        I believe any time that you start a new venture, there are challenges that you have to face; the same was true for us as well. Before this year, we didn't have an established space for manufacturing our products. We had to start the production in our home spaces. Ambarish was using his house's balcony, and I utilized the front yard of my house in my hometown to manufacture our products. Since we were dealing with biochemicals and enzymes and not any hazardous acidic or toxic substances, we were able to kickstart our products using our family resources and start the production at home.
                                    </p></li>
                                    <li>
                                        This constraint limited the quantity we could produce, but we decided to make that trade-off and proceed with the production anyways. At that time, we believed that it would be a good start even if we could deliver to 5-7 customers satisfactorily.  
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>What marketing strategies have you adopted, and are you planning to reach your target customers better?
                                </h4>
                                <p>We started by using contacts like relatives and seniors working in these industries for marketing. This helped us in getting initial validation for our products.
                                </p>
                                <p>Secondly, many cities have environmental consultants that are sole proprietors of providing solutions to industries in these cities. The industries also trust these consultants since they have long-standing corporate relations. So we are in contact with these consultants who can create a regular supply for our solutions in these industries. </p>
                                <p> Thirdly, we rely on directly emailing our target customers and word of mouth that is slowly being built around our products. </p>

                                <p>It's a good question. So basically, to gauge the expansion and growth of our company, we can look at parameters. The first one is the number of industries in which we employ our solutions. The second one is the quantity of water/waste treated every day. So currently, we are focussing on the second parameter; we aim that even if we are dealing with 2-3 industries but as long as they can help us get closer to the target quantity of water & waste that we want to treat, it is ok. We aim to treat 10 million litres of water every day by the end of next year.</p>

                                <h4>What are your thoughts on start-up culture in IIT Bombay? Do you see the possibilities of improving it?
                                </h4>
                                <p>I consider IIT Bombay to be one of the fortunate institutes with a start-up and entrepreneurship infrastructure far better than most institutes in the country. SINE, where I worked, started in 2000 under a different umbrella when the idea of entrepreneurship itself was a bit alien in our country. Later it was renamed SINE in 2004. Secondly, we have the Desai Sethi Centre for Entrepreneurship, which helps build a thorough knowledge base in the minds of students who want to pursue entrepreneurship in their professional careers. Our institute also has a vibrant atmosphere of research and development, which is one of the most critical parts of getting out good start-ups. We have a research park that facilitates academic research collaboration with industrial innovation. So when all three of these aspects come together, it creates a very supportive infrastructure required for entrepreneurship. So, in my opinion, IIT Bombay is one of the best places in our country where you want to be if you are thinking of creating your start-up and making it big. Through my time at SINE and as a student in our college, I felt that the culture of entrepreneurship is improving slowly but surely in our institute.
