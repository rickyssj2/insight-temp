                <p>Hey! I'm Ammar, currently a fourth-year student in the Aerospace Department at IIT Bombay. I'm a passionate aerospace enthusiast who unexpectedly ended up pursuing a non-core internship. Can you believe that until the first week of August, I had no plans of doing an FMCG internship? (The interviews for Day 1 happen in the second week of August.)
                    </p>

                <p>Probably not, right? Well, that was the case, and I'm here to share my journey with you.</p>
                <p>Let's go back to the summer before the internship season. I was unsure about what I wanted to do (and it's perfectly fine if you feel the same way). Throughout my time at the institute, I had mostly focused on tech-related activities like the Aeromodelling Club and AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). However, I realized that I no longer wanted to pursue a tech-oriented path. So, I had four options in front of me:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Consult (cause half of instizens with zero relevant tech skills choose this</li>
                    <li>Software (DSA kabhi nahin kiya life me)</li>
                    <li>Analytics (Sasta Software)</li>
                    <li>Finance (wanted that finance bro vibes)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I didn't even consider FMCG, assuming it was exclusively for students from the chemical/mechanical branches. With this mindset, I applied for all the Day 1 IAFs. Unfortunately, I didn't make it to Consult Day-1 Shortlist. Given that my resume was filled with tech-related experiences, I had a feeling it would turn out that way.
                    </p>

                <p>P&G (Procter & Gamble) was the only FMCG company open to Aerospace students, so I decided to give it a shot. After the disappointment of not making it into the consult shortlists, I had only one interview on Day 1, which was with P&G. Although I wasn't sure about FMCG, I researched the field and sought advice from seniors. In the end, I thought to myself, "It's just an internship, it'll anyways give me a taste of corporate life."</p>
                <p>Now let's talk about the selection process:</p>
                <p>1. Psychometric Test - P&G places strong emphasis on its PVPs (Purpose, Values, and Principles). They administer a psychometric test initially, consisting of situation-based questions to assess how well you align with the company's PVPs. Once you pass this test, you gain access to the Logical Reasoning and Mental Ability Test.
                </p>
                <p>2. LR/Mental Ability - This stage is relatively basic and resembles puzzle games like Sudoku. You need to find the signs and recognize patterns. After completing this test, they shortlist candidates based on their resumes.</p>
                <p>3. Group Discussion - This round is essentially a three-person interview conducted simultaneously. The interviewers ask open-ended questions, and you need to captivate their attention through compelling storytelling. My advice is to prepare a wide range of experiences that showcase your leadership skills or how you have solved challenging problems. This round is the primary elimination stage, after which the personal interview takes place.
                </p>
 
                <p>4. Final Interview - P&G only had one interview on Day-1, which was more or less a HR round and it flowed like a conversation. I almost instantly knew I aced it.</p>

                <p>Now, let's move on to my internship experience. After the selections in August, P&G started reaching out to us in March to initiate the onboarding process. We were informed about our work locations, and mine was Mandideep, a town near Bhopal. I was a bit nervous since it was a remote area, and I wasn't sure how I would manage my accommodation. However, P&G assured us that they would provide hotel stay for the entire duration of the internship.</p>
                <p>As for the work itself, I'm currently assigned to the Feminice Care - Whisper Plant, where my role involves identifying predictive maintenance opportunities. I'm responsible for developing Key Process Indicators (KPIs) that help the company determine when maintenance should be performed for specific parts. This requires me to collaborate with numerous individuals on the production line to understand equipment failures and communicate with vendors to find effective solutions.</p>
                <p>One of the aspects I love about working here is that it's not a typical desk job. I get to work in a state-of-the-art factory, where everything feels vibrant and alive. I interact with various people and listen to their fascinating stories. The technicians are particularly enthusiastic about sharing their experiences, and I've enjoyed building strong relationships with them.</p>
                <p>However, I do have one complaintâ€”the food in the plant canteen is similar to what you would find in a typical mess. I'm tired of having dal chawal every day. Nevertheless, the work itself has been incredibly rewarding. I've come to appreciate the significance of taking a structured approach to problem-solving. Understanding complex business issues and finding solutions requires careful analysis, but every day I'm discovering new strategies to effectively prioritize tasks and achieve my goals.</p>
                <p>Apart from the work, P&G genuinely values its employees, and it shows. Everyone here feels valued and exhibits a sense of ownership. The company is made up of its people, and the people are the company! :))</p>
                <p>As I approach the end of my internship, I am certain that I will cherish these last two months filled with learning and fun! :D
                </p>
                <p>If you've made it this far, let me give you my two cents: It's okay not to know what you want and to explore different options. You still have plenty of time. Don't confine yourself to applying for specific profiles just because they align with what's already on your resume. Instead, have fun, enjoy the internship season, and don't stress out! Wishing you all the best! <3 </p>
