              <h5> A brief introduction about yourself</h5>

              <p> Iâ€™m Prerna Agrawal, a fourth-year UG in the Aerospace Dept, IIT Bombay. I am currently the Overall Coordinator of Student Alumni Relations Cell. I have been a part of the Aero DAMP team for two years and also completed a second-year internship at Godrej Aerospace, Mumbai. I am an INTER-IIT Volleyball Player and good at football and badminton. For me, public speaking and oratory is always a go-out thing.
            </p>
            <h5>How did you find out about this internship and what made you pursue it?
            </h5>
                        
                <p>I got the internship offer from BAJAJ Auto Ltd. through PT Cell itself and my interest in core made me pursue it. </p>
                <h5>Could you describe the selection/ interview process?</h5>
            
              <p>IAF opened, resume filtering, technical test, two rounds of interviews</p> 
            <h5>How did you prepare for the internship?</h5>
              <p>I had prepared for tests as there were mechanical questions in it, and I am from the aerospace department. Apart from this, I talked to seniors to learn about the interview process. </p>
            <h5> Could you brief us about the work allotted to you?</h5>
              <p>I am in the research and development field and am involved in finding out ways of making engine testing of two-wheelers more efficient.</p>
              <h5>How has the experience of working been? What was the process of shifting to a new city like?</h5>
              <p>Wonderful experience in an office with a good work culture. saw some ups and downs in the start while shifting to Pune but soon settled with good friends around.
                 </p>
          <h5>What is something you wish you had known before the internship?</h5>
              <p> the leave policy in Bajaj
            </p>
            <h5>Is there anything you explored outside of the internship? What was that like?</h5>
              <p>Time management was a difficulty in the start but I have learned a lot during the internship period.
            </p>
            <h5>Is there anything you explored outside of the internship? What was that like?</h5>
            <p>It's just that Bajaj has enough to let you explore apart from your own project, so much of my time is spent there only. Pune as a city has been explored less, but it's good overall.
            </p>
            <h5> What are things one should keep in mind before joining this internship?</h5>
            <p>your interests should be the first priority, and knowing the hands-on experience of seniors before joining.</p>
           <h5>Any tips for juniors for making the most out of the opportunity to do an internship?</h5>
            <p> Explore yourself to the fullest before applying for any company
