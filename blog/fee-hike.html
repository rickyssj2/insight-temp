                            "On 19th July 2022, about 100 students from the institute gathered in the main building to protest against the recent massive fee hike. The gathered students aimed to submit an open letter signed by 1000 students to the director stating some student demands concerning the fees hike. However, security personnel stopped the group on the ground floor. The group continued their protest on the ground floor and later handed over the open letter to the two Deputy Directors and the Registrar of the institute, who came to address the protesting students.

                            The Fee Hike: Explained
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            From the beginning of the academic year 2022-23, there had been concerns regarding the PG Fees hike, as was mentioned in the fee structure of the new students entering PG and PhD courses in the institute. There were doubts about whether the new fee structure would later be applied to students for all the batches or just new entrants. And according to the latest fee structure, the fee hike has been applied to students from all the batches currently enrolled in IIT Bombay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fee hike has been different for different batches of PG students. There has been a massive increase in the tuition fees for the new entrants in MTech and PhD courses across different categories, with the hike for MTech new entrants being 500%. The other components of the fees like Gymkhana fees, registration fees and examination fees have been increased for both new entrants and on-roll students by 25-30% each. There has been no increase in the tuition fees of on-roll MTech students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Besides this, administration has now introduced a new component called Hostel Amenities Fund (HAF), which was earlier part of Semester Mess Advance (SMA). Students will have to pay INR 1800 as HAF apart from SMA. Students have pointed out that even after the dissolution of HAF from SMA, no change or update has yet been mentioned in SMA, resulting in the possibility of an increment in total fees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that there have been claims that Gymkhana fees have been raised by 340%, however, this is false. This percentage increase compares with Gymkhana fees during COVID times when the administration only collected a nominal substitute for the component. But when the comparison is made with the pre-COVID figures, the component is increased by 30%.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h3 class="h3">Protests and Demands of the Students</h3>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This fee hike has created great unrest in the student community. The major concerns of the students surrounding the fact that with absolutely no increase in the number of scholarships being offered by the institute, no increase in the financial support of the existing scholarship and no mention of an increase in the TA Stipend, it might be difficult for some students to support their education. The fact that none of the student representatives was priorly informed regarding the decision of this hike has added to the sentiments against it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Concerned students have started participating in protests and have some demands that they want the administration to adhere to. Some of these short-term demands are as follows, with a request for immediate action on the below pointers:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Withdrawal of Fee hike</li>
                                <li>Extension of last day of payment</li>
                                <li>Recommendation of hike in Fellowship with the inclusion of DA (Dearness Allowance) Component</li>
                            </ul>  
                            Students have some demands regarding the long-term structural changes as well. These include the formation of a student committee that have a part in decision-making while fee structures are discussed in the institute so that the opinions of the students who have to bear these changes can also have representation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Students want there to be transparency regarding the components of the total fees that are part of the fee structure. They want explainations regarding the utilisation of funds that have been collected from them as these fees components.  Some students have also raised concerns regarding the Hostel Rent Allowance (HRA) and Travel Allowance issue. According to UGC guidelines research scholars must either be provided hostel accommodation or in case it is not possible hostel rent allowance must be provided to the students. Students have pointed out that though administration has provided accommodation to all the research fellows, they have to pay the hostel fees commonly paid by any other student across the campus. Single (Non-Married) students aren’t given HRA if they want to stay outside; however HRA is provided to married students staying off campus.  Some anomalies have also been pointed out in the travel allowance being offered to research fellows.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="h3">Communication from the institute:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Besides the official circulars stating the revised fee structure for PG students, no official circulars or information has been released by the administration justifying or stating the fee hike. While speaking to a national newspaper Director Subhasis Chaudhuri stated that “The infrastructural development cost is coming from borrowed money- the loan that the institute is taking from Higher Education Funding Agency. The repayment can be made only through the revenue generated from tuition fees. Our fees are very low even after the hikes. These students also get monthly stipends. Internationally, the cost of masters’ programmes in engineering runs in thousands of dollars,”. They added that the institute had deferred the hike for two years. Besides this, the Deputy Directors, while addressing the protesting students, assured that they will look into the demands of the students and will also arrange for an open house discussion on the fee hike this week.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="h3">Protests, Campaigns & Open House</h3>
                        <p>
                            The protests continue inside the institute, the collective manifestations of which can be seen on the campus and on social media in form of posters, banners, pamphlets,  posts and even memes. On the 19th of July, a protest happened at the Main Building, in which the open letter was submitted to the institute's Deputy Directors and Registrar. A group of students protested again in front of the convocation hall on 21st July with banners with demands like withdrawal of fee hike and the ones mentioned above. There have been calls for daily silent protests in front of the SOM building. Students have also requested an open house session with the administration regarding the fee hike on 26th July 2022.
