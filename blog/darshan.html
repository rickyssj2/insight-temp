                        <p><strong>12th February afternoon: </strong>On the 12th of February, Darshan Solanki, a
                            first-year undergraduate student from the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Indian
                            Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) passed away. The news of his demise has deeply
                            affected the IITB community.</p>
                        <p>Darshan, a student from the SC/ST community, fell from the 7th-floor refuge area of Hostel
                            16. The incident occurred in the afternoon around 1PM. One of the security guards called the
                            ambulance, and he was immediately rushed to the IITB hospital, where he was declared dead.
                            The body was transferred to the civic-run Rajawadi hospital, where the post-mortem was
                            carried out. No physical suicide note was found. Investigations are currently underway to
                            determine the cause of this tragic incident; an interim report made by the internal
                            investigation committee was released on 6th March.</p>
                        <p><strong>12th February night:</strong> On the same day, a candlelight march occurred around 10
                            PM. Students gathered in the common area of Hostel 12 and marched to Hostel 16. Upon
                            reaching there, a few of the attendees expressed their thoughts about various issues faced
                            on campus, including academic stress and challenges faced by students from reserved
                            categories, among others. </p>
                        <p><strong>13th February: </strong><br>The Director formed an internal committee to investigate
                            this tragic incident.</p>
                        <p>A condolence meeting in memory of Darshan Solanki was held at 6:30 PM in the LT Lawns.
                            Several students, faculty and representatives from the administration attended the meeting.
                            The meeting was presided over by the Director, Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri, who addressed the
                            loss and provided his condolences to the family and friends of Darshan Solanki.</p>
                        <p>
                            The meeting began with two minutes of silence in memory of Darshan Solanki, during which
                            people stepped forward to pay their respects to him. The meeting was formally closed with a
                            request from the Student Mentorship Program Coordinators (SMPCs) to not make conjectures
                            about the circumstances surrounding the unfortunate incident and wait for the official
                            investigation to conclude. They also said that students were welcome to stay back, pay
                            respects and share their thoughts if they wanted.
                        </p>
                        <p>A few students expressed their thoughts and began to raise concerns including those about the
                            adequacy of support structures on campus for marginalised students. They also demanded that
                            the Director hold an open house on the issues on a non-instructional day so that a maximum
                            number of people could attend and voice their issues.</p>
                        <p>The Director assured the students that the administration would work towards improving
                            support structures and conduct a meeting with a smaller group of students who wanted to
                            discuss issues. However, these students were unsatisfied with this response and continued
                            demanding an open house. The Director expressed that though the administration was open for
                            discussion, the condolence meeting was not the appropriate time or place since it was held
                            to respect the memory of the student. The Director left the gathering without any further
                            announcements while students continued to make demands.</p>
                        <p><strong>14th February: </strong><br>The internal committee began its investigations.</p>
                        <p>The Public Relations Office of IITB put out a statement, based on the initial inputs from
                            Darshan’s friends at that time, refuting the claims in news articles that the death was
                            caused by discrimination. The statement requested that unfounded allegations are not spread
                            and asked for people to wait for the official investigation to conclude. The statement went
                            on to say that students are warned about discrimination and are sensitised to not seek proxy
                            information about caste via entrance exam ranks from the moment they step into IITB, stating
                            that “While no steps are 100% effective, discrimination by students if at all it occurs, is
                            an exception."</p>
                        <p>In the past year, Institute Student Mentors were instructed not to discuss or use JEE ranks
                            as icebreakers with their mentees; however, it is unclear if students from the first year
                            were sensitised against such activities; this message had not been relayed in the SC/ST
                            Students Cell’s freshers orientation.</p>
                        <p><strong>15th February:</strong> Allegations of caste discrimination were made based on
                            statements made to the media by Darshan Solanki’s family and a senior student whom Darshan
                            Solanki had confided in. </p>
                        <p>No official complaints had been made to the Police or the SC/ST Students Cell of IITB as of
                            15th February. According to the statements made by the SC/ST Students Cell and Student
                            Wellness Centre to the Mumbai Police, Darshan had not approached either of these two bodies
                            to complain about caste-based discrimination or any other issues during his stay at IITB.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Based on the observations made by the internal committee, the interim conclusion (as of 6th
                            March) of the interim report includes the following statement: "Other than the statement of
                            DS's [Darshan Solanki] sister, there is no specific evidence of direct caste-based
                            discrimination faced by DS during his stay at IIT Bombay." Details can be found in the
                            interim report.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>17th February | Demands made by student collectives:</strong> Some students,
                            primarily from collectives such as APPSC, ASC and Dastak, gathered in the LT Lawns to submit
                            a letter containing a list of their demands to the Director. It should be noted that the
                            views and opinions of these student collectives are not representative of the entire student
                            community.<br>The letter, which was signed by the three aforementioned collectives, listed
                            various demands broadly aimed at: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Improving the representation of and support for SC/ST students</li>
                            <li>Pushing for an internal investigation committee with 50% representation from the SC/ST
                                community and one external member to investigate the case</li>
                            <li>Sensitising students, faculty and staff on caste and mental health, and</li>
                            <li>Conducting an open house to discuss structural issues</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The complete list of demands is linked below.<a href="#down">Link</a></a><br>
                            Demands by other students, not mentioned in the letter, included the creation of a common
                            complaint platform for all types of discrimination and bullying, the arrangement of
                            additional TAs for PwD students, and prompt academic support to be given to students with an
                            FR.</p>
                        <p>An email was sent by the Director requesting the campus community to provide any information
                            which they believe may be relevant to the incident by meeting any of the committee members,
                            or emailing the convener, Prof. Nand Kishore, or the police.</p>
                        <p><strong>19th February: </strong> In response to the nationwide call for a march, a second
                            candle march was organised on campus in memory of Darshan, starting from Hostel 12, with
                            sporadic calls and slogans for justice. The march then settled in the basement of the main
                            building, where a few students expressed their views on the structures and administration on
                            campus. They reiterated some demands which they had also presented to the administration.
                            They also urged the people to depose to the internal investigation committee and to join
                            their call for justice and action.</p>
                        <p><strong>2nd March:</strong> The interim report of the internal committee was submitted. A
                            summary of the report and its full version was released by the Director on 6th March.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">Steps taken by the administration and SC/ST Students Cell</h3>
                        <p>The following are the immediate steps taken by the administration:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An internal investigation committee was constituted on 13th Feb; it is headed by Prof.
                                Nand Kishore, who until recently was the Chief Vigilance Officer, and includes SC/ST
                                Student Cell members, including both faculty and students, the In-charge Chief Medical
                                Officer of the IITB hospital, wardens from Hostel 16, Associate Dean of Academic
                                Programmes, one of the overall coordinators of the Student Mentorship Programme and the
                                General Secretary of Hostel Affairs.
                                5 out of 12 committee members are from the SC/ST community. Anyone with relevant
                                information regarding the case is requested to reach out to them.
                            </li>
                            <li>Ms Anisha Mathews has been appointed as the new SWC In-charge. Furthermore, job postings
                                for 1 SC and 1 ST counsellor to be part of the Student Wellness Centre were announced on
                                17th February 2023. The application end date is 19th March 2023. The administration
                                stated that this had already been planned as per suggestions from the Ministry of
                                Education after the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes took cognisance of the lack
                                of mental health support for SC/ST students in early February 2023</li>
                            <li>The refuge areas have been locked until bird netting is added. This is to avoid any
                                cases of students falling from the area by accident. Barriers will also be put up on the
                                edges of various terraces.</li>
                            <li>The administration has expressed concerns about moderating the discussion and
                                maintaining decorum in an open house, but have stated that they look forward to student
                                participation and suggestions to improve its support systems.</li>
                            <li>In his mail to the institute, the Director mentioned that a committee has been formed to
                                examine the issues of academic stress among first year UG students and recommend
                                measures to mitigate the same under the convenership of Prof. Kishore Chatterjee, the
                                head of the EE Department.</li>
                            <li>The administration also stated that they are working on changes in the UG curriculum,
                                which was implemented starting with the batch of 2022, intending to make it more
                                motivating and relevant to students and reduce academic stress. The DD AIA also stated
                                that the administration is planning on implementing changes in the grading pattern,
                                among other steps, to reduce stress, especially in the first year.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In light of concerns raised about caste discrimination on campus, Insight inquired about
                            steps taken by the administration and the SC/ST Students Cell in the last year aimed at
                            supporting SC/ST students and making the campus more sensitised:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A sensitisation course on “Caste in the Workspace” has been in preparation since June
                                2022 and will be entering the video production stage. This is being overseen by the
                                SC/ST Students Cell with guidance from academic experts from the HSS Department and will
                                be mandatory for students, faculty and staff. The DD AIA stated that the goal is to
                                complete the course before the start of the upcoming academic year, Autumn 2023.</li>
                            <li>The Cell also established a voluntary mentorship program in May 2022 and allows students
                                to choose mentors based on department and language. A training program was carried out
                                for the mentors by the Mariwala Health Initiative, following an internal orientation
                                conducted by the Cell itself.</li>
                            <li>A mandate for the SC/ST Students Cell detailing its objectives and functioning, the
                                roles of its members, and the procedure for complaint redressal was drafted and is under
                                discussion in the Core Committee of the SC/ST Students Cell.</li>
                            <li>A list of caste slurs is being expanded. It has already been completed for a few
                                languages and is available on the website of SC/ST Students Cell.</li>
                            <li>The Cell will continue to put up anti-caste discrimination posters around the institute.

                            The incident has highlighted the issue of mental health and well-being among students,
                            especially in high-pressure environments such as IITs and amongst students from marginalised
                            communities. The IITB administration has acknowledged the need to prioritise mental health
                            initiatives and support systems to ensure the well-being of all its students.

                                    <li>We would like to remind the student community that making anti-reservation
                                        statements or casteist comments amounts to caste discrimination—a crime and a
                                        punishable offence. We request that the student community be mindful of the
                                        sentiments of the SC/ST community, who are a rightful and integral part of IITB.
                                        Caste-based discrimination is a very serious problem, the brunt of which falls
                                        upon the SC/ST community.</li>
                                    <li>Any student experiencing caste-based discrimination, including but not limited
                                        to: anti-reservation statements (being told that they are unmeritorious and
                                        undeserving of being in IITB), caste slurs and abuses, being asked to reveal
                                        their caste identity through direct and indirect ways (such as asking surnames
                                        explicitly, JEE rank, family/ancestral occupation, etc.) and facing isolation
                                        and alienation based on their caste, is encouraged by the Institute and the
                                        SC/ST Students Cell to approach the SC/ST Students Cell for complaints and
                                        support.</li>
