              <h1>Thomas Jacob - AWL Inc</h1>
              <h2>Introduction:</h2>
              <p>
                Hey, I’m Thomas Jacob, a fourth year undergraduate in the
                Department of Electrical Engineering. I interned at AWL Inc.,
                Hokkaido, Japan over the summer in an online mode.
              </p>
              <p>
                I come from a town called Bhilai, which you might have heard of
                because of the Steel Plant if you paid attention in geography
                class. I like football (Real Madrid fans wya) and music, which
                are two things my personality can essentially be broken down
                into. On the academic side of things, I am broadly interested in
                machine learning, but more specifically, I am inclined towards
                the applications of machine learning in medicine, which is
                another field I have grown to like over the past few years.
              </p>
              <h2>Internship Selection Process:</h2>
              <p>
                Before conclusively deciding between getting into a university
                for pursuing research or going corporate after my undergrad, I
                wanted to have a taste of both lives. Following my second year,
                I was fortunate enough to have done a research internship at TU
                Braunschweig, Germany, and so, after my third year, I was more
                inclined towards a company internship focused on machine
                learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                The internship season starts around the beginning of August,
                when companies start coming through the Placement Cell to hire
                summer interns. From a preparation standpoint, I only went over
                the important concepts in ML - through previous courses, online
                resources, etc. One aspect I was lacking in was DSA (Data
                Structures & Algorithms for the uninitiated), and that took a
                few companies offering ML interns off the table since they used
                DSA as a filter during their round one of testing. All these
                considerations made me target the Japanese companies from the
                get-go due to their primary focus on your research experience
                and skills relevant to the job description. The IAF from AWL
                Inc. immediately caught my eye as it opened up, as it had
                everything I had expected from a good internship: an interesting
                job description, decent stipend, and it was supposed to be in
                Japan (aaaaaa).
              </p>
              <p>
                The first round, which was for everyone who had signed the IAF,
                was a test consisting of basic machine learning questions, and
                was fairly doable provided you were good with your concepts. The
                second round was supposed to be a technical interview so I was
                pretty nervous thinking about what they would ask. The interview
                was conducted by two people, of which one was an alum from the
                institute, who was pretty chill and put me at ease regarding the
                interview. The entire interview was centered around my resume
                and they asked me to choose any one project from it and explain
                it to them. I chose the work I had done during my internship at
                TUB the previous year and went over the details, such as the
                task involved, the data processing I had done, and the network
                architectures I had used and why I chose those specific
                architectures. At one point, I was also asked to share my
                screen, open up a research paper related to my project, and
                explain the details of the paper to them in a gist. I felt that
                I was able to do a good job since I had already gone through the
                paper a few times during the internship and they seemed
                satisfied with my explanation at the end. And that was it, they
                just asked me a few routine questions after such as if I had any
                doubts regarding the internship. I was expecting another round
                of interviews after this if I was fortunate enough to get
                selected but this turned out to be the final round, and
                thankfully, I was selected! I was immediately really excited
                thinking of all the fun stuff I would do exploring Japan xD.
              </p>
              <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
              <p>
                Life had other plans sadly, the world was still reeling from
                COVID, and the new Omicron variant only delayed things further.
                By the time Japan opened up its borders in March, there was a
                flood of VISA applications from everywhere and the company let
                us know that it would not be possible for us to get our VISA on
                time, and it would have to be an online experience sadly (FML).
                I made H2 my home (thanks Achintya ka box room <3) for almost
                the entirety of my internship, so I could at least have fun with
                my friends post working hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                The internship started on the 9th of May, when we got a broad
                overview of the work we would have to perform and got to meet
                our supervisors who were super friendly. We were all divided
                into two groups based on the tasks our supervisors felt we were
                suited for. I, along with another friend, were assigned to their
                Core AI Team while the others were assigned to the SDK team. The
                work was really interesting, we had to explore newer deep
                learning frameworks specialized for inference on edge devices,
                get familiarized with their APIs in languages such as Python or
                C++, and use them to carry out model testing. The entire
                experience was great and not taxing at all, with the supervisors
                being very considerate. Plus, they take work-life very
                seriously, and we were not expected to do any work at all beyond
                our usual working hours and even mandating a one hour break
                during our actual working hours. We had review meetings three
                times a week, when we broadly went over the work we had done up
                until that point and asked for any support we needed or any
                questions we had. Beyond this, we just had a few presentations
                to report any significant findings we had made from time to
                time. This is pretty much how it went on up until the second
                week of July, which was when our internship ended after a final
                presentation to all the company employees, who were all very
                appreciative and supportive :)
              </p>
              <p>
                It was overall a very very positive experience, even though it
                was online, due to the fun nature of the job, and the extremely
                friendly work environment.
              </p>
              <h2>Parting Thoughts:</h2>
              <p>
                The internship season can feel very taxing at times, especially
                seeing your peers landing up with interns while you are still
                struggling for one. To everyone going through this, I would just
                say, don’t worry, you will get there eventually too. There will
                be a lot of opportunities coming your way during the entirety of
                the season. And one other thing would be to go for a job profile
                of your interest, as opposed to, say, a profile offering you
                more money because while money may seem more enticing in the
                moment, the experience you gain while working on something you
                like would only go onto help you in the future, when you are
                thinking about job prospects. TLDR; choose working on something
                you love over corporate slavery.
              </p>
              <p>
                Huge thanks to everyone who read this till the end, I can’t
                imagine the effort since I have never been able to do it myself.
                Finally, a lot of thank yous and apologies to Insight for
                pushing me to do this and constantly dealing with my
                procrastination (free hugs for all of you).
              </p>
              <p>
                All the best to everyone and feel free to contact me, in case of
                any questions :)
