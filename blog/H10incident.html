                                person in it. A hastily shot, dark, 3 second clip was found on the canteen worker’s
                                phone, that was taken at the same time the incident occurred. It was suspected that this
                                was an attempt to record a video which led to the workers being taken for interrogation.

                            The canteen workers of Hostel 10 were taken for interrogation by the Mumbai
                            police, <i>
                                after reports surfaced that one of them attempted to secretly record a video of a
                                resident of the hostel while she was in the bathroom.

                                The incident happened on Sunday night, when the victim raised the alarm after noticing
                                someone holding a phone through the window slits in one of the bathrooms in H10. She
                                immediately reported the incident to the hostel council and authorities, after which
                                there was a manual checking of the phones of the canteen workers, since they were the
                                only male staff members present at that time in the hostel premises.
                                <i> The quick response team, the ADean SA and Dean SA were also called to the hostel and
                                    a hastily shot, dark, 3 second clip was found on one of the canteen worker’s phone.
                                    The video was taken around the same time the incident occured because of which it
                                    was suspected that the video could have been at attempt at making a recording. </i>
                                An FIR was filed and all the canteen workers were taken for interrogation by the police
                                at around midnight.
                            </p>

                                <i>The canteen had been closed on Sunday due to pest control and the canteen workers had
                                    been given permission to enter the the hostel premises to carry out the pest
                                    control.</i>
                                The bathrooms in some wings have windows which overlook a platform-like area that is
                                connected by pipes reaching till the ground floor. The alleged perpetrator climbed the
                                pipes to one such area that enabled him to gain access to the windows into the
                                bathrooms.

                            </p>



                            <p>

                                The H10 canteen now remains closed indefinitely. Steps are being taken to ensure that
                                the mess staff consists entirely of female workers, barring a few male workers who will
                                be needed to lift heavy loads. Furthermore, they will not be allowed to access the rest
                                of the building.

                            </p>


                            <p>
                                This act of sexual harassment has caused great distress to the residents, who now feel
                                that they are not safe in their own hostel. Bathrooms that have windows overlooking pipe
                                areas are vulnerable to sight, as are bathrooms that have a considerable gap between the
                                floor and the door (like in H15). Unless the infrastructure of these washrooms is
                                changed, there will always be a possibility of such incidents happening again. There is
                                a noticeable lack of CCTV cameras in most of the lifts and corridors of H10.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                According to the hostel rules, all male (students, family or workers) seeking entry into
                                the residential area have to be accompanied by a female. However, Insight has noticed
                                that some unguarded lifts could be used to gain access to the residential area by a
                                person having access to the mess or the common ground floor area. It is also possible to
                                sneak into the common ground area and then access the unsupervised lifts. Furthermore,
                                there are no guards posted in the area where the perpetrator climbed the pipes, which
                                opens up the possibility of someone else climbing them. The hostel council needs to
                                ensure that such breaches of security do not occur.
                            </p>

                                Incidents like these are likely to happen at any girls' hostel, and have so in the past.
                                The council and authorities should take all possible measures to ensure that the female
                                residential area is not accessible to people with nefarious intentions.
