                            interrogation by Police</h1>

                        <p>
                            <b>18-09-22:</b>
                            The canteen workers of Hostel 10 were taken for interrogation by the Mumbai
                            police, after reports surfaced that one of them secretly recorded a video of a resident of
                            the hostel while she was in the bathroom.

                        </p>
                        <ol>

                            <p>
                                The incident happened on Sunday night, when the victim raised the alarm after noticing
                                someone recording her through the window slits in one of the bathrooms in H10. She
                                immediately reported the incident to the hostel council and authorities, after which
                                there was a manual checking of the phones of the canteen workers, since they were the
                                only male staff members present at that time in the hostel premises. The quick response
                                team, the ADean SA and Dean SA were also called to the hostel and the deleted footage
                                was found in the phone of one of the canteen workers. An FIR was filed and all the
                                canteen workers were taken for interrogation by the police at around midnight.
                            </p>
                            

                                <p>
                                    The canteen had been closed on Sunday due to pest control but the workers had been
                                    in the hostel premises during that time. The bathrooms in some wings have windows
                                    which overlook a platform-like area that is connected by pipes reaching till the
                                    ground floor. The perpetrator climbed the pipes to one such area that enabled him to
                                    gain access to the windows into the bathrooms.
                                </p>
                            
                            

                                <p>
                                    The H10 canteen now remains closed indefinitely. Steps are being taken to ensure
                                    that the mess staff consists entirely of female workers, barring a few male workers
                                    who will be needed to lift heavy loads. Furthermore, they will not be allowed to
                                    access the rest of the building.
                                </p>
                            

                                <p>
                                    This act of sexual harassment has caused great distress to the residents, who now
                                    feel that they are not safe in their own hostel. Bathrooms that have windows
                                    overlooking pipe areas are vulnerable to sight, as are bathrooms that have a
                                    considerable gap between the floor and the door (like in H15). Unless the
                                    infrastructure of these washrooms is changed, there will always be a possibility of
                                    such incidents happening again. A suggestion to put up CCTV cameras in the corridors
                                    was shot down by the H10 authorities because of privacy issues.
                                </p>
                          

                                <p>
                                    According to the hostel rules, any male (students, family or workers) seeking entry
                                    into the residential area has to be accompanied by a female. However, Insight has
                                    noticed that some unguarded lifts could be used to gain access to the residential
                                    area by a person having access to the mess or the common ground floor area. There is
                                    also the possibility of people sneaking into the common ground area and then
                                    accessing the unsupervised lifts. There are no guards posted in the area where the
                                    perpetrator climbed the pipes, which opens up the possibility of someone else
                                    climbing them. The hostel council needs to ensure that such a breach of security
                                    does not occur.
                                </p>
                               
                                
                                 

                          
                                <p>Such incidents are likely to happen at any girls' hostel, and have so in the past. The council and security in such hostels need to ensure that the female residential area is not accessible to people with nefarious intentions. </p>
