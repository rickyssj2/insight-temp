                        <h1>Amol Goel - Bain & Co.</h1>
                        <p>
                Hey folks! I’m Amol Goel, a final year undergraduate student at
                IIT Bombay, majoring in Economics(BS Economics). I’m from
                Faridabad, Delhi NCR. Academically, I’m inclined towards
                research in Game Theory and its applications in different
                microeconomic/macroeconomic problems (for instance,
                game-theoretical simulation models to capture tax-payer -
                tax-authority interactions, hmu anytime you’d like to have a
                chat about it). More professionally, I’m interested in business
                strategy and management, and outside of work I enjoy traveling,
                cricket, kick-boxing and binging Netflix. I’ve also spent 4
                months of university at Geneva School of Economics and
                Management, University of Geneva as an exchange student, but
                let’s not digress there because that itself can make for an
                entire blog :D
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, deep diving straight to the main subject for today, I’ve
                been working as an Associate Consultant Intern at Bain & Co. for
                the last 6 weeks and I’m gonna be doing so for another 3 weeks.
                For the uninitiated, Bain & Co. is one of the leading Management
                Consulting firms in the world along with BCG and McKinsey. I
                scored this internship through the well-known internship season/
                process at IITB (It’s a process where the meticulous folks at
                Placement Cell and the IC team work hard to bring different
                companies to our campus for hiring interns across various fields
                and roles). Unwinding a bit to July 2021, I was very confused
                about which company to target for during the internship season,
                however, I did have the clarity that I wanted to work either in
                an Investment Banking role or a Management Consulting role,
                since I had been reading a lot about them in my second year and
                I knew I could be a good fit there because it matched my
                interests and temperament. But sooner than later, I realized
                that there is not a single reputed firm that comes to hire
                Investment Banking interns from our campus, so naturally I
                decided to go after Management Consulting firms and put all my
                efforts there. Now, I know many of you might not have this
                clarity about going after which firm or field, but don’t worry
                you’ve got ample of time right now and what you should really do
                is scorch the internet to find out more about the work profiles
                of different companies/ fields that come to our campus and try
                to identify what interests you and could be a good fit for you
                based on your temperament. Coming back to July 2021, we got the
                news that Bain and BCG are coming for internship season this
                time, which was surprising because this was the first time that
                Bain and BCG decided to hire undergraduate interns. This news
                really lifted my spirits since now there were a greater number
                of firms offering an internship in the Management Consulting
                domain, which simply increased my chances to score one. With my
                elevated spirits, I attended PPTs of all the big consulting
                firms that come to our campus – Bain, BCG, LEK and Strat&. After
                carefully listening to all the PPTs, talking to a few seniors
                and doing some research on my own, I was very clear that Bain is
                where I wanna work at the next summer (largely because of its
                work culture, people, growth opportunities and its seamless
                hiring process) and so I signed up IAFs and filled my priority
                order accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, let’s talk about the interview/selection process and my
                preparation strategy for the same, which I think you’d be most
                interested in :) So, the selection process for consulting firms
                is fairly simple and straightforward but very exhaustive since
                it examines you on multiple fronts. The process is divided into
                2 stages – 1) Resume Shortlist and 2) Case Interviews. As far as
                the first stage is concerned, they’re looking for very detailed
                yet streamlined resumes which typically demonstrate peaks in 2-3
                sections (could be academic, previous work experiences,
                extra-curriculars, international exposure etc.). What I did -
                jotted down all the points I could think of on a word document
                and then I started arranging them in different sections and
                refining them. After 4-5 iterations and getting feedbacks from
                seniors, I was finally ready with what I thought could be a
                winning resume. After that, all I had to do was sit tight and
                wait for the resume shortlist to come out, and prep for the case
                interviews at the same time. Case Interviews prep was actually a
                very interesting process for me since it exposed me to a
                plethora of business problems and their potential solutions
                (however shallow or preliminary, they were, which I now
                realize). Yeah, so I think around July end, the shortlists came
                out and I made it to Bain’s shortlist – that was a hooray!
                moment for me. After that, I was assigned 2 buddies (primary and
                secondary) from Bain who basically helped me prep for case
                interviews and tried bringing me to the level that interviewers
                would be expecting. This went on for 2 weeks, wherein I did
                multiple mock case interviews with both of them and also with my
                friends with whom I had been practicing cases earlier too (Key
                resources I used – CIC YT videos, books – CIC and Day One).
                Yeah, so these two weeks of constant feedback and improvement
                went on and finally the interviews took place. I had 2
                sequential rounds of interviews – one with a senior manager and
                other with a partner, both rounds entailed different cases – one
                on cost cutting and the other one on business expansion. Both
                rounds went smooth, I had a good conversation with the
                interviewers and amidst the 2nd round, the partner gave me a
                spot offer. I remember shouting “YES!” and throwing a punch in
                the air without realizing my mic and video was on the entire
                time :D Later had a fun conversation with the interviewer about
                the same.
              </p>
              <p>
                Right, so next I’ll jump into my internship experience so far. I
                opted for the Gurgaon office majorly because of my liking for
                the city (metro, food, privilege to go home once in a while and
                more). In consulting, you’re basically staffed on a case in a
                specific industry depending on the requirement of the case team.
                I’ve been working with a leading player in the Indian consumer
                electronics sector on their business expansion strategy across a
                particular vertical. My work so far has been concentrated around
                market research, competitor benchmarking and price-demand
                elasticity analysis. I wouldn’t go any further into the
                technical details but to give you an overview it has been pretty
                exciting working with a leading company in consumer-tech space,
                understanding their business model, seeing how business problems
                are solved in real life and what kind of a structure is
                typically followed while devising a growth strategy. Team has
                been very accommodating and super helpful throughout. Moving to
                the softer aspects now, the firm has been pampering us with
                gifts even before the internship started, we’ve been placed in a
                5-star hotel in our respective locations for the entire duration
                of the internship. And on top of that, we just had our mid-term
                presentation in Goa, where the firm put us in a fancy resort and
                organized a flamboyant party later in the night. Pretty exciting
                right? Apart from the knowledge that I’ve gained while working
                on the case, I think I’ve definitely grown as a person through
                this internship, learning how to approach a particular problem,
                structuring my thoughts, presenting something in an efficient
                manner and of course getting comfortable with Excel and
                PowerPoint since they’re what you use day-in and day-out. The
                sustainability (working hours) is very case specific but for me
                and most of my friends it has not been a problem so far.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, I’d like to end this long monologue with a few words of
                advice for all of you, who’ll be entering the internship season
                this year. First, please relax, I know all of it is overwhelming
                and there would be times you’d be stressed but panicking or
                comparing yourself to others is not gonna do you any good.
                However, entering this process with a positive mindset, a calm
                head and an attitude to genuinely learn and come out of this
                process as a better version of yourself would go a long way in
                ensuring that you come out winning when its over. You should
                always keep in mind that this is not the end of anything, it’s
                just an internship that you’re after and that you’ll get many
                more opportunities in the future. Having said that, please also
                don’t enter this process with a callous attitude too, it’s a
                great opportunity to learn and work at very reputed firms at a
                young age and you should give your best to make the most out of
                this opportunity. At this point I’d like to bid you adieu and
                thank you for your attention and sticking till the end. All the
                very best for the upcoming internship season and feel free to
                reach out to me if you have any more questions :)
              </p>
                      <p>
                      Cheers!
