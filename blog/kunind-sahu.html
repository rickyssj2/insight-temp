                        <h1>Kunind Sahu - AmEx</h1>
                        <p>
                            Hey everyone! I am Kunind Sahu, a BTech thirdie (to-be-fourthie) in the MEMS department. I am pursuing a dual minor in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from CMInDS, IIT Bombay. Yes! I’m back to bore you with yet another long write-up, this time about my summer experience as an Analyst Intern at American Express. So, without further ado, let’s dive into it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Points 1-6 talk about my experience in the internship season and AmEx’s selection process.
                            Points 7-10 talk about my actual internship experience.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Internship Season Profile Selection</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I kinda had an idea of what I wanted to do - I wanted to go for roles which involved Machine Learning - essentially the analytics domain (although not the entirety of it). I was sure that I wasn’t interested in applying for roles along the lines of ‘business analyst’ because they were non-technical in nature.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The basic idea was that I had done a second year summer research internship - where I was exposed to how Machine Learning was being employed in an academic setting. This time around, I wanted to experience the corporate world and how Machine Learning was being used in the industry - maybe in some kind of industrial RnD or some rigorous application of Machine Learning.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Although I did not enjoy software development much, I nevertheless decided on applying for some software development roles as well. I had done a course on Options Pricing over the summers through Finsearch, organized by Finance Club - that got me all interested in the field of quantitative finance as well, so I applied to a few quant finance roles too.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I wasn’t quite enthused by consulting at that point of time, and even if I wanted to go for consulting roles, I knew that my profile was not well suited for getting consulting shortlists, so I ended up not applying for any consulting roles.<br>
                                    In summary, the profiles I decided to go for were - Analytics (ML), Software, Quant Finance.

                                </p>

                                <h3>Preparation for the Internship Season</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I have written in detail about my internship season preparation right <a href="https://wncc-iitb.org/">here</a>.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Internship Season (The Day 1 Experience)</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The internship season was nerve wracking to say the least. As I’d mentioned above, I wanted to work with ML in the corporate setting - either an RnD role or some good application based ML role. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Unfortunately, none of the Day 1 companies were open for my department (only open for CS, Elec and sometimes BS Math) - which, it goes without saying, was quite demotivating. I was shortlisted for a few Quant Trading companies - but was not selected for either one of them (this could be the topic of discussion for another write-up someday haha - don’t want to make this a prolix write-up). Apart from one company (Optiver), Day 1 went by without much activity with respect to shortlists/selections.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                                <h3>American Express in the Internship Season</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The American Express IAF had opened just after the Day 1 companies announced their results. Their job profile fit well with my expectations of my third year summer internship (a reasonably rigorous application of ML).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    American Express was hiring in their Credit Fraud and Risk (CFR) division for the upcoming summer. The CFR team is responsible for developing state-of-the-art Fraud Detection models to prevent credit card fraud and catch possible defaulting clients.The fact that I had quite recently done a course project on Credit Card Fraud detection made me all the more excited about this role. Interesting team? Check. Good work? Check. Great company? Check. The IAF was immediately signed ;)
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Background about AmEx</h3>
                                <p>
                                    AmEx is a financial services company, which issues its own credit cards and corporate cards - which are invite-only. It usually tends to operate in the premium high spending segments. In this way, it is kind of different from Visa and Mastercard.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Any credit card transaction has three entities associated with it. You have the consumer, who’s buying a commodity with their credit card, you have the merchant who accepts the card and sells the commodity, and then you have the technology network over which this transaction takes place (Visa, Mastercard or AmEx). Let’s assume the customer’s bank (which issued the credit card) is HDFC, the network of the transaction is Visa and the Merchant’s bank is SBI
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Visa and Mastercard don’t issue their own credit cards - they are issued by the respective banks. In our above example - the customer’s data is held by HDFC Bank, the transaction information (and metadata) is held by Visa and the merchant’s information is held by SBI. No single entity has access to the complete data about the transaction here.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This is where AmEx comes in. AmEx issues its own cards - thus AmEx has complete information about any of its credit card transactions - information about the customer, about the transaction and that of the merchant. This forms a <strong>closed loop</strong>, which AmEx leverages in its ML models to make them state-of-the-art. Having access to the complete data enables them to better capture fraud and mitigate potential risks. Additionally, it was the <strong>very first company</strong>  to deploy an ML based fraud detection model in its actual day-to-day workings - this was done in 2014.
                                </p>

                                <h3>AmEx Selection Process</h3>
                                <p>
                                    There were no DSA rounds in the AmEx selection process<br>
                                    The selection process involved:
                                </p>
                                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
                                    <li>
                                        <p>Resume Shortlisting</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>
                                            ML Based Test (Those who did well were shortlisted for the interviews)
                                            which comprised very easy MCQ questions on Machine Learning (basic ML knowledge was required to ace the test)

                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>
                                            Interview (2 Rounds)<br>
                                            The interview comprised two rounds - none of them were really demarcated as Technical / HR. Both kinds of questions were asked in both rounds.<br>
                                            The major focus of the interviews was my resume, specifically, the projects I did, especially the one on credit card fraud detection. We had worked quite extensively (tried many techniques, quite a few of which failed) - which made for quite an amazing discussion.<br>
                                            I was pretty familiar with the mathematical details and workings of all the algorithms I had implemented in my projects - thus I tried to steer the interview in that direction. I did go quite deep into the mathematical aspects of the algorithms I had used. Apart from the resume, a few AmEx specific questions to know if I knew about the company (<a href="https://youtu.be/hPPNJ0_Dyhk">how is</a> it different from its <a href="https://youtu.be/3Oz0piahbt4">competitors</a>, why AmEx etc),  and two puzzles. All in all, I left the interview feeling quite confident about my performance.

                                <h3>The Internship Experience (Offline?!)</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Officially, to our dismay, the internship was being conducted in an online mode. The company had sent laptops to us - which were supposed to be used for work and had access to the company’s intranet. Although, internally, AmEx had this Flex policy where employees could voluntarily choose to come to the office. Once I got to know this, I discussed it with my Manager and packed my bags and left for Gurgaon as soon as possible. The internship, though officially was 8 weeks long, you effectively only had 6 weeks to work. The last week is the presentation week and the first week is packed with onboarding and introductory sessions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The projects are allocated shortly before the commencement of the internship - and they are live projects - allocated on the bases of your skills and knowledge. My project was on defaulter profiling using machine learning. Essentially, I had to answer the question - within the defaulters, were there any sub-groups / clusters forming, if yes, in what way were they different (ML model explainability and prescriptive analysis). It was an RnD project - something which had not been explored much by the company before - so nobody knew what to expect! It was quite engaging and fun to do.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Oh boy, I’m so glad that I chose to go to Gurgaon and work in the office rather than working from home. AmEx owned an entire building in the One Horizon Center campus in DLF Phase 5 Gurgaon (although that was not its best office in Gurgaon. The best office, which was on the top floor in the main building of One Horizon Center - was closed :/). I got to meet my immediate and the extended team and was able to network with all of them! Since the internship programme was online, I wasn’t able to network with interns, except the one who was on my team.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Talking about Gurgaon, I was kinda let down by the city - especially by the lack of street food culture, even though Delhi was so close to it. But yeah, we did explore the city a lot and found some good places to eat (Sector 46!). My PG flatmates (the ones from IITB) and I did go out over the weekends and went around - especially to places in Delhi. I did have many insti friends interning in Delhi, one of whom claimed that Delhi was much much better than Mumbai (personal attack) and I was expecting that friend to show me around. Long story short - don’t expect anything of your consulting friends XD.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    AmEx had this awesome complimentary cab service which could be availed to travel to and from the office from your residence, they even provided cabs with security guards at night to ensure the safety for the female passengers. I used to brag about this a lot to my other IITB friends who were staying with me in my PG (they were working in another company which did not have a lot of perks attached to the job role. Those who know, they know XD). Additionally, the workspace was quite open and there was a huge monitor on each workspace - (a dream for any programmer!), especially since the laptops provided to us by the company were small, I always used to plug my laptop into the monitor and project my screen and felt like a pro-coder oof.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I was working on the team of the very same Vice President who’d taken the second round of my interview. Mid-way during the internship, he had taken out the entire team managed by him - including the directors, managers and all the other levels had out for a treat! There were many such outings I had with my team. Haha, one of the perks of taking extra efforts and going to Gurgaon all the way from Mumbai and working from the office (and being a super enthusiastic intern xD). How could I forget to mention this, shortly before our internship commenced, AmEx had changed its dress code from business casuals to smart casuals, that was a kind of added bonus for me, because I did not have to do any additional shopping for formals (in the end, I did end up shopping for new clothes :P).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There used to be many food outlets in the cafeteria of the office - one of which sold box meals. Although the taste was fine, the quantity was not, leaving me hungry. Whenever they asked me for reviews, I always rated them 1-2 stars and complained about the quantity. Guess what, in two weeks they increased the quantity of the food being served in the box meals (felt like I won the world :P). Also, how can I even forget the “corporate subsidized” Subway and Costa Coffee. Whenever I did some good work, I treated myself to a delicious cup of Hot Chocolate (Costa Coffee) and a Peri-Peri Chicken Sub (Subway) as a pat on the back (okay this is getting too self-adulating, I’ll end this bit here).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Oh, how could I forget Friday Catch-ups! My team has this culture, where the entire team meets every Friday evening for about an hour or so. Not to discuss work. To chill out and play team games :). Every week, one member comes up with a game and organizes it for the others. Codenames, Skribbl, Drawbattle, Psych – we played it all. Well, I had a suspicion that I was really good at Pictionary and Dumb Charades, but it was always hypothesized on small sample sizes. Now that I actually played with my team, the hypothesis more or less checked out XD. The AmEx work culture is nice and supportive and people there are really helpful and eager to help you out. Anyway, this is pretty much how it went until the first week of July, by which time I had my end-term presentation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Frankly, I’m glad that I chose to go to the office and work from there - I was able to network with people (though not as much as I would have been able to if things were completely offline, but hey, it was something). I also met two IITB alums there (although quite late, but its alright) - all in all it was an enthralling corporate experience - something which I’ll certainly remember.

                                    The internship was great, but it was also not without a few minor snags. I was not granted access to a lot of internal AmEx tools early on, because of which there was some delay in beginning my work.<br>
                                    Also, when I began my work, I needed to use some libraries which were not present on the system. But I was unable to download them directly (legal concerns and all), so I had to wait for some time to get those downloaded as well.<br>
                                    Unfortunately, some time into the internship my manager caught COVID as well, (I’m not blaming him of course!).<br>
                                    These were minor snags which I felt reduced the speed of the internship, without which we could have done some more work. But overall, I’m thoroughly satisfied with my learnings and all the work which was assigned to me!

                                <h3>Skills Developed During the Internship</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I’d say that the internship was more about applying the skills I was already familiar with - to try to solve a problem the company was facing. Nevertheless, I did learn quite a few things - improved command line scripting, knowledge of new state of the art ML algorithms and patience (:P) when the ML algorithms are running (I was manipulating a massive real life dataset comprising 3 years’ worth of data - even with AmEx’s strong hardware, it took some time to process.<br>
                                    Also, I learnt a lot about AmEx’s business practices and their usage of closed loop to create best-in-class ML models and about their business model and leveraging all that information to improve upon their services.<br>
                                    Last but not the least, and one of the most underrated of the lot - presentation and communication skills. It was super important to present my work and findings well - the people watching my presentation would be from diverse backgrounds (technical/non-technical), many of whom were not at all familiar with what I’m doing. Thus, I needed to present my work in a way such that it was understood by all.

                                    Yeah yeah, I’m finally done with this yet another overly prolonged and unnecessarily detailed write-up about yet another internship experience of mine (*sheepish smile*). Now, its time fo the final words.

                                    On a serious note, the internship season is a good experience to have. Its also a great opportunity to learn more about your preferences and interests. Yeah, Day 1 companies are great, but it doesn’t mean that if you don’t get “Day 1”, the internship season is over for you. Not at all! Quite the contrary in fact, there are many good companies which don’t come on Day 1 - AmEx being one of them. Actively look out for such opportunities around you, which are to your liking and of course, do ask the interviewers more about the job profile and the kind of work that would possibly be allotted to you.

                                    Also, I can’t stress on this enough, please please please keep in constant contact with your friends; keep talking to them, prepare together, it’ll help improve both of your moods and would kinda act as a morale booster. Internship season is of course a super important period (and super stressful too) in your stay here at IITB. There are surely going to be times when you are going to feel really down and not up for it - talking to your friends would always help you out :).

                                    Thank you soo much for staying with me until the end of this long monologue-ish story/experience write-up. Another shout out to Insight for giving me this opportunity to pen down my thoughts about my internship. All the best! Do feel free to contact me, I’d be happy to help in whatever way I can :D
