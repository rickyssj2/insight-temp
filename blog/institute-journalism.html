                        <p>
                            <strong>Q. What attracted you towards Insight?</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A. Writing, for me, is a form of artistic expression. There’s beauty in being able to create
                            a
                            symphony with words–to paint a picture of your internal thought and offer it to fellow
                            readers and see your ideas flame to contagion. Such power to fundamentally alter someone's
                            perspective, to reorient belief systems, to galvanize action with a well-written, targeted
                            story. But this power is not the only thing that makes writing so seductive. Your emotions
                            and personality color your tone and word choice. Your way of thinking dictates your
                            narrative and argument structure. Is there a better way to peek inside and gather insight?
                            “To understand the world, read. To understand yourself, write.”
                            Conversations can be earth-shattering experiences. The excitement in seeing the evolution of
                            two-people’s understanding of a topic just by offering a slice of their perspectives to each
                            other is a gift. Where else, other than Insight, can you find people who resonate with your
                            philosophical sophistication? Where else do you find people hungry to listen to your ideas
                            and generous to offer their own?

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Q. Favorite piece you've worked on for Insight.</strong></p>
                        <p>A. The Virtual Labs article, by far! The sheer challenge of handling a sensitive topic,
                            ensuring an unbiased expression of student views, faculty perspectives and admin policies
                            through interviews and discussions was very engaging and meaningful. Four of us worked for 4
                            months to create this piece. </p>
                        <p><strong>Q. One key thing you'll take away from your tenure.</strong></p>
                        <p>A. Coming up with a first-draft feels very challenging. But, the real value-addition happens
                            during repeated iterations. Each contention makes your argument stronger, each suggestion
                            opens a new dimension, each comment highlights your blind spot. That’s why working in a team
                            is important, that’s why we welcome diversity in thoughts and experiences.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Q. What's your favourite memory related to your tenure (could be a funny incident or
                                anything :P)?
                            </strong></p>
                        <p>A. The handing over treat is my most cherished memory. Most of our tenure was online, and
                            surprisingly, I met many of my fellow editors in-person the first time at the end of our
                            tenure, during our handing over treat. We got drunk, danced like crazy apes and had the time
                            of our lives.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q. How much did you enjoy on-ground work versus writing/editing for
                                journalism?</strong></p>
                        <p>A. On-ground work is essential to the journalist experience. It’s a crucial part of the
                            job.That said, I am a sucker for writing. Give me a topic to read and write about, I’ll be
                            the happiest person in Earth. But, I do enjoy talking to professors and alumni.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q. Overall, how has your experience been working in Insight?
                            </strong></p>
                        <p>A. Better than anything I could have asked for. The editorial board is a group of incredibly
                            capable and helpful people. Getting to know them and working side-by-side will certainly be
                            a cherished memory. Looking back, it was probably an exception among the slew of
                            “less-than-reasonable”-decisions in my four years at IIT Bombay :p</p>

                            </Strong></p>
                        <p>A. One of the major reasons was that the work associated with Insight has a direct and
                            visible impact. Further, I was excited by the brainstorming of new ideas and having
                            discussions within the editorial board.</p>

                        <p>A. The treat in Lonavala was amazing! AmMo's board gathered together in-person for the first
                            time :)
                        </p>
                        <p><Strong>Q. Overall, how has your experience been working in Insight?</Strong></p>
                        <p>A. My experience has been amazing. Insight provided me a great platform to cover different
                            topics and pen down views on it. There was a lot to learn from the fruitful discussions
                            during the ed board meetings. Since my tenure as ed board member was during the online sems,
                            it also helped me stay connected with all the happenings in insti :P</p>

                        <p><strong>Q. What attracted you towards Insight?
                            </strong></p>
                        <p>A. As someone who had never taken up a PoR before, I was keen to be a part of some student
                            body before I graduate. I have always enjoyed writing and so a board member of Insight was
                            the perfect opportunity to channel my interest towards something more interesting. After
                            having spent a year at home due to COVID, the possibility of meeting new people as part of
                            the board was also enticing. I spoke to a few current and ex-editors of Insight; each one
                            spoke positively of their experience. Hence the decision to apply for a board member of
                            Insight</p>
                        <p><strong>Q. Favorite piece you've worked on for Insight</strong></p>
                        <p>A. I enjoyed working on an article which described the plight of international students at
                            IITB. I got to interact with the international student community and connect with them so as
                            to understand the problems they face on campus. Subsequent research on how top universities
                            welcome international students and cater to their problems was very interesting. The sheer
                            depth and breadth of analysis we carried out to understand the root cause of the problems
                            was exciting.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q. One key thing you'll take away from your tenure</strong></p>
                        <p>A. Since I mostly worked on long articles, the biggest takeaway from my tenure was the
                            ability to think about a problem from all perspectives. I realised how similar it is to
                            research. Formulating a hypothesis, testing it with research/surveys and presenting the
                            conclusions in a clear concise manner are very important skills, which I honed as an editor
                            of Insight. Equally important are the people I came across and the friendships I got to
                            forge with some amazing people!</p>
                        <p><strong>Q. What's your favourite memory related to your tenure (could be a funny incident or
                                anything :P)?
                            </strong></p>
                        <p>A. I enjoyed a few informal sessions and conversations I had with the team, especially with
                            my ChiefEds :D Too embarassed to mention them here :P</p>
                        <p><strong>Q. Overall, how has your experience been working in Insight?
                            </strong></p>
                        <p>A. With placements, prep for further studies and my DDP, I was a little anxious about
                            burdening myself with too much work during my final year. In hindsight, it was a great
                            decision! As a maggu throughout my first four years, I learnt so much about our Insti
                            culture as part of Insight. I made new friends, got to work on articles addressing real
                            issues and present them to the Insti junta. The brainstorming sessions with the board were
                            stimulating; it was great to hear about so many diverse perspectives on any particular
                            issue. If only my tenure would have been completely offline; can’t imagine how much more fun
                            that would’ve been!</p>

                            </strong></p>
                        <p>A. I was always an avid reader, which led to an inclination for creative writing. I also
                            liked the concept of journalism a lot, and liked to stay updated on current affairs from
                            around the world. Insight lay at the intersection of all of these interests. Through
                            groundworks, I realised the freedom and flexibility given to editors to pursue articles as
                            desired, which was another major factor in pushing me to join Insight.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q. Favorite piece you've worked on for Insight</strong></p>
                        <p>A. By far it is the Election Special Edition. The interviews which revealed controversial
                            information, the late night discussions on how to tackle the flaws in the current system of
                            elections, attending soapboxes and questioning the candidates made me feel like I was a part
                            of something big. This article covered all bases and gave me the complete "investigative
                            journalist" experience.</p>

                            </strong></p>
                        <p>A. One time I was sent to report about a fire in the new CSE building. On reaching there, I
                            found out that the fire had already been put out by firetrucks. Nonetheless, I posed and
                            took photos in front of the building, making me feel like the "Disaster Girl" from the memes
                        </p>
                        <p><strong> How much did you enjoy on-ground work versus writing/editing for journalism?
                            </strong></p>
                        <p>A. Most of my tenure was online, so very little of the work I did was on ground
                            unfortunately. Based on whatever little on ground work I did, I feel that an offline tenure
                            would have been really fun and interesting.</p>

                        <p><strong>Q. What attracted you to joining IITBBC?
                            </strong></p>
                        <p>A. My interest in filmmaking, creating video content, and admiration for transparent
                            journalism pushed me towards applying for the convener position at IITBBC. IITBBC seemed to
                            provide me best of both worlds. It also provided me with the freedom to work on whatever
                            topic I might find interesting. The student-centric projects were very much fun to work on.
                            Hence, subsequently, I applied for the OC position as well.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Q. Favorite piece you've worked on for IITBBC</strong></p>
                        <p>A. Without a doubt, the Campus Reboot series. <br>
                            It was a 2 part documentary series revolving around the phase-wise reboot amidst the
                            Covid-19 pandemic. It was much needed at that time given the confusion amongst students
                            about what exactly was the rationale behind various rules and policies, how exactly the
                            admin and STF were working, and did they have student interest in mind. We also covered the
                            other side of the story, students' perspectives, and opinions. This project had a lot of
                            components to it. The joy of taking a step closer to providing a transparent platform for
                            communication between both parties was something that I hold dear.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Q. Key things you'll take away from your tenure
                            </strong></p>
                        <p>A. Firstly, people. All the people that I interacted with as a part of IITBBC– alums,
                            seniors, peers, juniors, conveners, etc– all had something to learn from. This network is
                            something I really want to preserve.<br>
                            Secondly, the power of perspectives. Everything is going on for some reason, but all we lack
                            are keen eyes and perspectives. Working with IITBBC, all of whose projects revolve around
                            people, I developed an appreciation for the beauty of all the different perspectives that
                            are present. <br>
                            These are some of the key takeaways from my tenure.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Q. What's your favourite memory related to your tenure (could be a funny incident or
                                anything :P)?
                            </strong></p>
                        <p>A. My favorite memory would be the freshers’ intro 2020. It was something very early in my
                            convener tenure and something very fun. Everything was online, and we were, for the first
                            time, making an online freshie intro. We were very excited. The online interviews with the
                            freshers were very fun, everyone was so cheerful and amazing. We interviewed from the
                            morning till late at night. During post-production, we sat entire days on Zoom and pulled a
                            couple of all-nighters, most part of which, apart from editing, was just going through as
                            many memes as we could xd. It was all fun. We made a lot of changes to each draft and
                            arrived at the final video. Our efforts paid off when this video became the fastest IITBBC
                            video to reach 1Mn views. The entire experience was amazing, fun, and very satisfying!</p>
                        <p><strong>Q.How were your experiences with on-ground work?
                            </strong></p>
                        <p>A. My most memorable on-ground experiences are during the shoot of the SOAPBOX and the
                            documentary on PAF. Half of my OC tenure was, sadly, online, so these offline projects had a
                            lot of new things to teach. During SOAPBOXes, we had to set up cameras at multiple places to
                            capture multiple angles which meant we had to keep a track of which camera is running out of
                            power so that we can replace the battery and put the drained-out battery on charge. This was
                            a big pain. But we eventually got used to it. Also, we had to deal with faulty and
                            inadequate inventory, which was a result of it simply lying in insti for 2 long Covid years.
                            Challenges apart, it was pure joy to interact with people face-to-face and capture
                            activities on ground zero. </p>
                        <p><strong>Q. Overall, how has your experience been working with IITBBC?</strong></p>
                        <p>A. Being a part of IITBBC is one of my most memorable experiences in insti life. There was a
                            lot of learning for me. I would do a lot of things that I otherwise wouldn’t do, being an
                            introvert. All projects, be it offline or online, documentaries or SOAPBOXes, and each stage
                            in them, be it writing or editing, interviewing or managing people, had something to teach.
                            The entire experience of my journalistic endeavors with IITBBC was very fruitful and
                            something that I would cherish for life.</p>
