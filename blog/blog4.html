                        Leaving college after a long stay as a student involves a
                        lot of work – lots of forms to fill and things to sort out.
                        To make this easier for you, we’ve compiled a ‘To-Do’ list.

                            The NAD ID is required on the convocation form, so sign
                            up at least a day before the deadline to fill out the
                            convo form (21st July). In case your Aadhar is not
                            linked with your phone, you can obtain the NAD ID by
                            emailing
                            <a href="ug_acad@iitb.ac.in">ug_acad@iitb.ac.in</a>
                            your NAD form.

                        <li>
                            Fill up the convocation form and pay the convo fees
                            (available at external ASC). It is necessary to fill up
                            the convo form in order to obtain NOC from the
                            department.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You also need to upload a scanned copy of the duly
                            filled and signed Convocation Form in the “Upload Signed
                            Convocation Form” available after filling the form. For
                            a step-by-step breakdown of the process, use the
                            following link:

                            Apply for the provisional certificate. A provisional
                            certificate is a document issued by the institute
                            stating that you have completed your graduation. It is a
                            temporary certificate that can be used to look for jobs
                            until the original certificate is issued by the
                            institute. You can apply for these directly through
                            external ASC.

                        Very few departments have provided information on No-Dues
                        certificates up until now. The following is the procedure
                        outlined by the MEMS department:

                        <li>
                            Graduating students are required to send a signed
                            self-declaration to the department office using the
                            format provided by the department.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can type this out, or write it on a white sheet of
                            paper, sign it, scan it, create a PDF file and mail it.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Before the presentation, choose the examiners for your
                            evaluation panel after consulting your project guide.
                            Get this approved by the department office and HoD.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After the presentation, send the final grade form to the

                            is not employed in IITB), send the Bank details to your
                            department office through email for disbursement of
                            honorarium.

                            explaining their reasons.
                        </li>
                        <li>
