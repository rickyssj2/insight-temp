                On the 29th of June, 2022, the SC/ST cell of IIT Bombay
                organised an open house on caste. It was the first such event
                organised by an official institute body and saw participation
                from students, faculty and the non-teaching staff of IIT Bombay.
                Participants were given a safe platform to speak about their
                experiences and voice their opinions to encourage a healthy
                discussion about the way caste influences life at IIT Bombay.
                One participant voiced that awareness about other kinds of
                inequality was much higher compared to caste and so it was
                important for this open house to take place frequently and for
                people of the institute to be more aware and sensitive to the
                issue of caste-based discrimination.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some speakers pointed out how caste is often invisible, it
                doesn’t formally play a role in your life after admissions but
                it shows up in subtler ways that can alienate you from your
                batchmates and can often lead to people interacting only with
                others from similar backgrounds. “Caste is like spectacles, you
                see the world through them but you never see the spectacles
                themselves," a participant quoted to describe how caste was
                viewed in the institute. Another point addressed in the session
                was regarding how it is often hard for people not belonging to
                one of these communities to understand the privileges that they
                might have enjoyed in life. Things that are taken for granted by
                someone from a more privileged background are struggles for
                people from the community and they bring these struggles with
                them to the campus. It was pointed out that coming in through
                reservation students may have feelings of imposter syndrome,
                wherein they feel like they don’t belong here and are unable to
                interact with people openly as caste is still an uncomfortable
                topic of discussion for many people on campus. Some students
                also mentioned how they were told not to tell people that they
                are from the SC/ST community as it will affect the way people
                view them. Some postgraduates mentioned that their guides
                finding out their caste and discriminating against them was a
                constant worry for them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The topic of reservation was also discussed in the open house.
                Reservation was introduced to ensure equality and adequate
                representation of communities that are socially and
                educationally backward due to lack of resources and the
                prevalent caste system. However, despite possible economic
                progress, they continue to remain socially disadvantaged and
                discriminated against. Some speakers said they understand the
                frustration some students might feel due to reservation but that
                it is important to look at the other point of view and
                understand why it exists and is still a requirement. People from
                the SC/ST community also talked about instances where their
                achievements are attributed to reservations and their caste
                results in their hard work and struggles often not being
                recognised. They went on to say this can be demotivating for
                people and often negatively impacts their state of mind. Some
                people also pointed out that the expectations they had from IITB
                of being an inclusive campus were not met. Some of them felt the
                burden of their caste here more than they had in their schools,
                possibly pointing to conflicts around reservation for this.

                There were a lot of interesting points brought up during the
                session and the SC/ST cell would be conducting more such events
                to foster discussion in the future. The insight team would
                encourage people to participate in these events to understand
                life at IITB from diverse perspectives. It is a safe platform
                facilitated by the cell to put your opinions forward and to work
                towards making the campus more inclusive.
