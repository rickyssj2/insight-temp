              <h1>Sanya - Crisil</h1>
              <p>Hey everyone,</p>
              <p>
                Sanya here, third-year student from Chemical Engineering. This
                is an attempt at describing my adventures during the summer (If
                only it were like an Enid Blyton novel).
              </p>
              <p><strong>After that, the Deluge </strong></p>
              <p>
                I was thoroughly confused at the end of my second year, torn
                between pursuing a glamorous (so they say) corporate life or
                taking the honorable path of research and academia.I felt like
                both areas had something substantial to offer and I didn’t want
                to miss out on any academic/personal/character growth by just
                choosing my path early on. Due to 1.5 semesters being online, I
                felt like I didn't have the sample space of experiences to
                actually compare the two and decide what fits my personality the
                best.
              </p>
              <h3>POA- Plan of Action?</h3>
              <h4>Act I</h4>
              <p>
                So, I decided to do what most people would probably warn you not
                to do; I decided to take a taste of both during the summers
                (needed my vacation to be as hectic as my semester :P). I
                applied for the position of trainee intern in CRISIL’s GIX and
                Advisory Department and got through after a couple of
                interviews. The role they were looking for was perfect for me as
                it sat at the intersection of the chemical industry and finance;
                they needed someone to assist in analysing the specialty
                chemicals industry in India and pan out its future.
              </p>
              <p>
                It involved analysing the financials and overall performance of
                companies present in the polymer additives sector and
                agrochemicals sectors. Work would usually revolve around reading
                and understanding economic macro trends of India and the world
                and fitting them in the context of the industry of interest. I
                had amazing, surprisingly chill mentors who recommended all
                sorts of chemical journals and books to me. A typical day
                involved going through balance sheets and news articles and
                consolidating presentations in the evening/afternoon time. One
                or two review meetings every 3 days or so kept things lively and
                rewarding.
              </p>
              <p>
                The office building was beautiful and the environment was quite
                different from college. However, the most important thing that I
                got out of my internship was was the experience of interacting
                and networking with people from different backgrounds.
                Connecting with people was something I did pretty late into my
                internship for a variety of reasons. I felt out of place since
                everyone else working around me was a MBA graduate and for a
                good part of my internship; I focused more on deliverables than
                actually connecting with the team. I took care of it in the last
                two weeks but that is something I wish I had done more. It was
                amazing to see how many women leaders were spearheading their
                sectors so well at CRISIL.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some secondary information that made it possible for me to carry
                out this internship: The office was 5 minutes away from campus
                and I used to love the morning walk to the office and back to
                campus in the evening for project work. There was also a ton of
                flexibility under which you could opt for work from home for 2
                days every week.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tenure for the entire internship was 1.5 months, but I got
                it extended by 2 more weeks after I was handed a new task on my
                request. So do look out for the kind of roles you'd like to take
                up, it's possible some of them are just around the corner and
                most companies are usually flexible enough to accomodate such
                requests. CRISIL was a great place to work, and there were
                plenty of food festivals, themed get-togethers, and informative
                webinars where you could interact, have fun, and learn new
                things.
              </p>
              <h4>Act II</h4>
              <p>
                Now coming to my research project, it was in the MEMS department
                and was a hands-on lab project. It involved synthesizing batches
                of silver nanoparticles and their subsequent characterization
                through SEM, XRD,TGA and other such tests. I had approached the
                professor at the end of my fourth semester as I wanted to get
                some experience working in the lab. I had told him and the post
                doctoral student I was working with about my internship. We
                agreed on the evening time for my share of lab experiments and
                that worked out smoothly. I feel it's very important to
                communicate to your guide about the kind of work commitment
                you're looking for and what else is occupying your day. Most
                professors in institute understand students' dilemmas and
                suggest solutions accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working in a lab added another dimension to my vacations. Lab
                culture was completely different from corporate culture and that
                needed me to evolve and learn fast. Research is a more long term
                commitment (on I'm still involved with xD) and I found the work
                to be slow paced and deliberate with a lot of attention to
                detail. There was more independence in carrying out experiments
                and synthesizing samples but with it also came a sense of
                solitude.
              </p>
              <p>
                So that's about it, summer went by with days in business formals
                and nights in a lab coat. I got used to this rhythm and also
                looked forward to the necessary weekends for unwinding with
                friends. Lesson in point here, make sure you don't burn out and
                if you do, learn to give yourself time to heal. At times, it did
                get stressful for me to manage my time properly and it got hard
                to maintain the appropriate work-work balance xD.
              </p>
              <h3>In Conclusion?</h3>
              <p>
                I know there is immense pressure to be passionate about specific
                things in life and to decide your career path as early as
                possible. As you might have inferred by now, I was extremely
                indecisive back then and found it difficult not to regret the
                road not taken. I put in some extra effort because I wanted to
                know for sure what I was doing was the best possible option for
                me. Looking back, I think I made the right decision. So I guess
                I’d urge you all to be comfortable with being indecisive and
                just take a leap of faith sometimes, you never know what you’re
                capable of until you’re actually put to the test.
              </p>
              <p>Good Luck!</p>
