                            Several of our alums have pursued various traditional and non-traditional fields after their institute life to follow their passion or to impact the world. One such story is the formation of the Pranayas Development Foundation. Pranyas Development Foundation is a Non-Government Organisation started by Rahul Sharma, an alumnus of IIT Bombay, in August of 2018, towards the end of his time at the college. He pursued a Masters degree in Electronic systems here at IIT Bombay and after graduation, he decided to pursue his long-standing interests in social services and resolved to work for the education and schooling of young children in underdeveloped areas. Hence, he decided to mobilise a group of people and form his organisation – Pranyas Development Foundation – which would comprise various individuals and volunteers working toward the same vision; that is, to help people and work for the betterment of society by aiding the growth and development of those most deprived.

                           To date, the organisation has been involved in helping a lot of people. More recently, two of the projects under their recent HOPE Model initiative include those of Panchayat Union Middle School (in collaboration with Elixir, IIM Trichy) and Government Higher Secondary School, Umariya (in collaboration with Pragati, IIM Indore). Both the projects at their root involved the renovation and repairing of the infrastructure and basic amenities – like installation of benches, washbasins, renovations of washrooms, painting of the school building, renovation of the water purification system, replacement of broken doors, windows, blackboards, and reparation of the damaged infrastructure etc. The project at Panchayat Union Middle School went on for approximately one and a half months. In addition to the basic reformations, they also installed two computer systems and funded the development of a smart classroom so that the children could be familiarised with technology and introduced to a wider scope of exploration and learning. Similarly at Government Higher Secondary School, Umariya, in the two-month project they undertook, after fixing up the basic requirements of the school they moved on to revamp the school grounds and construct a badminton court so that students may, in addition to academics, have options to learn about and pursue extracurriculars like sports as well. In addition to these projects, another impactful way this foundation is making its contribution to society is by counselling and talking to the families in the regions they take under their wing. They provide constant counselling to families and try to convince hesitant parents to send their young daughters to school and complete basic schooling. They also provide counsel to the students who face difficulty in getting through grades due to unfavourable circumstances and lack of resources. All of their efforts have culminated in visible improvements and developments due to which the organisation decided to come up with a formal roadmap to get more people involved and be able to reach more regions: the HOPE Model.

                            The HOPE model is a sustainable model the organisation uses, to ensure the benefits are felt for a long time. The organisation partners with social clubs of institutes to decide what villages/areas to adopt. Children adopted under the model are then connected with nearly 20 donors, who are provided with a weekly report of the child's progress containing the academic growth along with extracurricular/moral growth. These reports also contain what the student further needs at various steps of education and donors can decide to donate for this as well, by connecting one child to multiple donors the organisation ensures someone willing to contribute does not have to worry about large sums and can take part with just a monthly contribution of Rs. 100. These reports are prepared by volunteers from the social clubs in the institutes. This provides transparency to all donors and also helps the student connect with their donors.<br>
                            Along with the development of children, the organisation also focuses on improving infrastructure in the village and for this purpose, it hires people from the villages. In the long term, the main focus will be on producing job opportunities, hiring people to maintain the libraries and as maintenance staff for other structures.

                            The organisation has also been working with Abhyuday at IITB and has adopted the entire ramjinagar slum, Ghatkopar. In December they distributed around 6000 notebooks and 300 school bags here. A form has been floated by Abhyuday for donors from IITB as well to get some contributions from the interested institute students. More such initiatives will be held in the near future so that more kids from slums/villages can be adopted under the HOPE model to aid in their overall development. Students can not only participate as donors but also participate as volunteers for the project, who collect reports, visit the areas and interact with the children. The continual efforts of Pranayas foundation to catalyse the development of the regions taken under their wing are very virtuous and impressive. We request and encourage all interested students to visit their websites and take a look at their work if they would like to get involved as donors and/or volunteers.
